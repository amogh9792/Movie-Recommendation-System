**Movie Recommendation System Project with Python Implementation**

This project introduces a movie recommendation system implemented using Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLP, and machine learning techniques. Leveraging the TMDb 5000 Movies dataset, the system suggests personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.

**Project Overview:**

1. **Data Collection:** The TMDb 5000 Movies dataset, comprising movie metadata, was utilized for analysis. This dataset includes information on movies, such as titles, overviews, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, merging datasets, and extracting relevant features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew were engineered to facilitate recommendation system implementation. Tags were generated by combining movie overviews with these features.

4. **Recommendation System Implementation:** Natural language processing techniques were applied to generate tags for each movie. Cosine similarity was then calculated between movies based on their tags, enabling the recommendation of similar movies to a given input.

5. **Model Deployment:** The recommendation system was deployed, allowing users to input a movie title and receive personalized movie recommendations.

**Solution Implemented:**

The solution consists of Python scripts implementing the recommendation system. Key components include:

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Performs data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, merging datasets, and extracting relevant features.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Implements feature engineering techniques to generate tags for each movie based on genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- `recommendation_system.py`: Constructs the recommendation system using NLP and machine learning techniques. Utilizes cosine similarity to suggest similar movies based on user input.

**Skills Utilized:**

- Python Programming
- Data Analysis and Manipulation
- Pandas and NumPy
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Machine Learning
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Recommendation Systems
- Version Control
- Documentation and Reporting

The project code and models are saved as pickle files ('movie_list.pkl' and 'similarity.pkl') for future use.
